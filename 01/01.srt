1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,640
好 哎呀 这今天得搂住啊

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,600
这个看到你们这样的时候 七哥真的是啊

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,360
今天本来想听木兰叫床声 这个没听到

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,040
今天我们很高兴和丹河老师同心同框

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,840
安红妹妹 大卫兄弟 木兰 卡丽熙

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,920
这真的都属于老革命啊

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,120
但是我特别给大家要重申的事情

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,160
就是当时啊 现场到了人少

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,400
可是大家要记住 从第一天 文贵跟很多人不一样的

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,360
就是我相信背后的战友

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,560
多过所有的欺民贼和共产党少说的数

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,400
今天也可以证明 你们当天没到现场的人

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,520
实际上很多人已经开始支持爆料革命了

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,080
那么包含很多今天没到现场的人 没出面的人

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,560
很多人都支持爆料革命了

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,600
这个当时记住啊 2017年

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,720
当我第一次爆料的时候

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,520
大家一定要记住 习近平晚上就打电话骂刘彦平

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,880
这是刘彦平自己说的

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,760
习近平给刘彦平打电话基本上是上帝给老百姓打电话的概率

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
拿起电话就把他祖宗八辈绝一尊

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,240
说你看郭文贵一个爆料怎么让他说话了呢 是吧

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,040
四亿多人次观看

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,200
永远这个词影响了我绝对爆料革命后来所有怎么看待的问题

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,720
班农先生当时就是我给班农先生说的话

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,720
我说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,160
这是最重要的

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,520
班农先生说习近平是谁 班� edge来说是习近平而已

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,960
班农先生说习近平是谁 班农先生说习近平是谁

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,360
今天你們要相信 從第壹天七哥是否對是錯的

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,860
是否是神經病

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,460
就像班農先生我要說搞這個112

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,560
班農先生說 不可能 絕對不可能

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,760
而且班農先生說了

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,560
你還沒等開了就把你抓起來了

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
與班農先生說的話

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,360
Miles 你要開就可能把你抓起來了

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
我說班農先生

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,260
不管發生什麽我們都會開

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,860
最後班農先生連夜在那塊兒就跟我壹個

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,260
你們不知道背後有多少故事

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,060
那些細節太多了

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,460
你們還很多照片資料還沒看到

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,960
很多信息還沒公佈

53
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,760
多了去了你看到那個表面

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,760
真的是壹點壹點 僅僅壹點

55
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,960
這就是今天妳看我和班農坐在這的時候

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
妳看好像三年壹晃就過了壹千天

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
200日子

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
所以說大家要看到

59
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,960
當妳今天在直播的時候

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,960
妳到再過三年後看今天又是天大的事

61
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,260
完全不壹樣這個世界

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,560
那麽今天我想說今天我特別大家要記住

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,360
不是因為楊丹和老師

64
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
安紅妹妹 大衛

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
我們的木蘭妹妹卡麗熙作為老同志在這

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,760
好像怎麽著就我剛才班農說的

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,260
人吃飯都要排的

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,160
班農先生話自然現象

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,760
他就得拉出像十腰炎 九指腰

70
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,360
錄大腦片這種事

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,460
我們要接受這種

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
這是個基本邏輯

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,260
第二最關鍵的事情

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,560
我們從來不孤獨

75
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,360
就剛才我離開我去出去有信息

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,560
某個我剛才給班農先生他也認識

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,560
某個跟班農先生原來就在馬拉哥會議上見面

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,160
人家跟我說

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,860
全家二十壹口人都來看現在的直播

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,960
然後讓我轉告班農先生

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
剛才我給他說了說

82
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,260
班農先生可以減肥

83
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,160
不能減太肥

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,260
不讓他減太多肥

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
你想全家二十壹個人

86
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,760
都在那塊現在看著告訴我

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,960
所以兄弟姐妹一定要記住

88
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
不是因為今天出來了安紅卡麗熙

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,660
也不是木蘭大衛兄弟

90
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,060
你們是代表人物

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,660
一定要相信背後的

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,460
全中國人百分之九十的人和九十五以上人

93
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,560
絕對他會最終接受

94
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,760
發自內心想幹的共產黨

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,460
這是你們今天一定要明白的

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
這是七個最想讓你知道

97
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,460
就包括班農先生

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,460
他絕對相信美國人最終全部都想著幹的共產黨

99
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,760
這是我們第壹天的

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,060
不是班農給我上床一百二十天

101
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
這是我們第壹天的

102
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
不是班農給我上床一百二十天

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:07:01,200
也不是為了牛肉 這是絕對的 這是個共同的信仰

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,760
大家不管你講多少 不管誰多偉大

105
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
永遠不要忘了這個主題

106
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
班農先生絕對不會為了錢活著

107
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,800
班農先生絕對不會為了容易活著

108
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,760
他一定會為他心中認為對美國最大的威脅活著

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,920
他幹掉這個威脅

110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:53,320
我是班農先生最好的Siles 我講完都愛班農

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,040
班農先生親眼見過很多人說我就是恨你

112
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,080
但我告訴這人說我看到的班農他們都愛上了班農 是吧

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,480
這就是我們親中國聯邦的力量

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,800
我們不但用我們自己的智慧

115
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,160
還要用行動證明給別人

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
大家想想這個法治基金我們花了多少錢

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,520
我們花了多於三百萬美金

118
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
首先只有在國內

119
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
現在在播放中 所有人都可以改善

120
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
我們在中國內部發了多少個帽子

121
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,240
一次 三百萬個帽子都在中國內部發了

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,200
在這裡 在南部 所有人都知道

123
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
但我們不把錢交給《國安法》

124
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
因為我們必須在亞洲購買

125
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,640
我們必須發給中國

126
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
全球 加盤

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,240
印尼 埃及卡 歐洲 所有地方

128
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,040
現在我們買了醫藥

129
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
一些錢是由《法律基金》

130
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,680
一些錢是由私人和家庭信用

131
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,520
我們花了超過一百萬美金

132
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,040
我們要讓大家一定要知道

133
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,880
我們捐過的 我們家庭絕對是超過一億的

134
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
不含戰友的

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,920
不含戰友的

136
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,800
我們是兄弟姐妹

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,360
我們是兄弟姐妹

138
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,480
在美國捐了超過五十萬美金

139
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,240
我們在外面捐了超過三百萬美金

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,160
我們捐了超過三百萬美金

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,920
那是很大的

142
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,120
我們沒有一個法律問題

143
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,720
沒有一個是由《法律基金》捐來的

144
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,360
我們百分之百可以保證

145
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,160
每一百萬美金的財產是用了

146
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,880
我們是兄弟姐妹

147
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,960
我們是對中共的承諾

148
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,120
我們是對中共的承諾

149
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
我們是對中共的承諾

150
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
我們是對中共的承諾

151
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
我們是對中共的承諾

152
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
這是今天第一次

153
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,120
我講到我們是好朋友

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
我們是好朋友

155
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,160
我們是好朋友

156
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,320
所以我相信

157
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
我們是五、十年來

158
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,040
《法律基金》和《法律基金》

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,600
我們是世界上最大的希望

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,720
我們是全球最大的希望

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,680
You know get more people committed

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,020
New federal state representative

163
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,600
New Chinese and new democracy

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
China government

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,680
I think so

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
所以说我觉得今天法律基金法律基金的意义在这里

167
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
今天我们要谈这个

168
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,720
然后1120我们最重要的

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,160
今天我们要说

170
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,520
那些今天蛋盒老师

171
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
安红戴卫

172
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,880
木兰卡丽熙的老战友在现场

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,520
还有当时没到现场的长岛哥和Q妹

174
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Q妹十几年前

175
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,320
跟她孩子跟她老公都已经是知识齐各了

176
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,280
所以说

177
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
哎哟你怎么说呀

178
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
英文单词啊

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,520
怎么说英语啊

180
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
Ccp

181
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,920
no me really is the same as the part of ccp

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
don't don't don't want to kill me

183

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,020
i want to ask

224
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,020
you know three years before

225
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,820

hundred hundred percent believe

227
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,520
mouse squad even our brothers

228
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,120
sisters

229
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,820
not all hundred percent

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,120
but you stand up

231
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,320
you support mouse squad

232
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
about our

233
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,220
visible movement

234
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,820
i don't know that time

235
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
how do you think

236
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,720
why use you believe

237
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,620
mouse squad what he said

238
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,820
it's very simple what what my miles

239
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,020
when he came to the west

240
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,120
gave a warning to america

241
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,020
about what the ccp was doing

242
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,520
and if you go back and look at

243
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,620
what miles has said and warned us about

244
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,520
it's by and large come true

245
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,020
whether it was h&a

246
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,420
whether it's a virus

247
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,220
whether it was taking of hong kong

248
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,020
if you look at all the major about

249
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,320
all the disappearances

250
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,020
you know what the anti-corruption

251
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,420
movement was going to turn into

252
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,520
so if you look at his warnings to the west

253
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,220
whether it was in the financial area

254
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
whether it was in biological warfare

255
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,220
whether it was in what the crackdown

256
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,620
in hong kong was going to be

257
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,220
a weapons

258
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,720
and and the latest one

259
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
and i have sat in the room

260
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,320
with many officials

261
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,420
and had miles go tell them about

262
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,720
the ccp's secret

263
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,220
base in uae

264
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,920
and seen people laugh at him

265
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,720
and the wall street journal

266
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,820
yesterday

267
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,720
talks about this military alliances

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,820
this base in uae

269
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,220
by the ccp so

270
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,320
i always judge somebody by

271
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
what they say

272
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,720
and then what they do

273
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,920
right and what he said in his warning

274
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
to the west and if we in america

275
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,920
had

276
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
embraced

277
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
that warning

278
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,820
back in 2017

279
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,520
when he first came to the united states

280
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,820
we'd be in a very different

281
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,920
situation today

282
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
we were never had

283
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,720
the ccp virus

284
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,920
we were never had this plague

285
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,720
that's been put

286
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,520
by the chinese communist party

287
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,620
throughout the world

288
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,920
in particular on the chinese people

289
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,820
so no that's

290
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
you know i you know people say

291
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,220
crazy miles grow

292
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,120
but i said hey

293
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
just look at what he said

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,820
and these are not small things

295
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,620
hna

296
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,020
and the corruption of the system is a huge thing

297
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,620
all the different financial companies

298
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,920
that he identified

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,220
as money laundering operations

300
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,320
huge thing all the people

301
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,220
disappearance

302
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,320
on 20 november of 18

303
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,020
we came forward

304
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,220
to talk about all that

305
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,420
hong kong

306
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,120
the base in the middle east

307
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,920
with with uae

308
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,220
you know the the virus

309
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,520
the military expansion

310
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,420
what the what the regime is doing

311
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,920
so now if you look at

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,420
go back and look at the track record

313
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,320
of the warnings

314
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,720
everything that came true

315
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,620
right

316
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,920
and how the world

317
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,820
we'd be different if we had

318
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
followed the warnings of miles grow

319
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,620
they'd be very very different

320
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,620
it'd be a very very different world today

321
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,320
so the degree that we have followed them

322
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,020
and have seen it

323
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,320
we we've been better for it

324
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,420
and it's his warning

325
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,220
is to the american people

326
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,420
to the entire west

327
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,220
and also warning to the chinese people

328
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
in the diaspora

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,020
unless we stand united against

330
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,420
the chinese communist party

331
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,520
they're going to just wreck

332
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,220
wreck more havoc

333
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,120
throughout the world

334
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,920
thank you

335
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,320

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,120
那我们小心

337
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
给他在你们分

338
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,820
翻译一下

339
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,420
简要的

340
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,420
好的好的

341
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,420
谢谢班农先生

342
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,620
班农先生刚刚就是

343
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,520
大概说就是因为文贵先生

344
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
有这个爆料

345
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
他给我们很多的

346
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
就是警示就是

347
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,820
如果你回去看的话

348
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,020
很多都已经实现了

349
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,620
比如说关于海航的爆料

350
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
关于香港

351
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,120
还有关于一些人员的各种

352
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,420
被杀害被消失

353
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,620
还有这个病毒

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,020
如果当时美国

355
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,520
的人能够听就是听文贵先生的

356
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,820
这个预警的话

357
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,120
那现在我们可能不会

358
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,020
有这个病毒

359
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,020
可能会是完全不一样的一个情况

360
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
然后呢文贵先生也是警示了

361
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
中国的人民

362
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,920
就是我们一定要团结起来

363
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,620
然后反抗才能够

364
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
把这个ccp的这个邪恶正体推翻

365
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,120
好谢谢小姐

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,620
so what

388
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,320
what plan do you have

389
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,020
in the next working

390
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,820
thank you miss bannon

391
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,020
he means the next

392
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,820
the next virus

393
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,920
so this one right now

394
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,420
yeah

395
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,020
yeah well look

396
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,620
first off

397
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,020
one of the ways that we can

398
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,120
we can stop it

399
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,520
is to get the truth out there

400
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,820
about exactly what it is

401
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,120
remember in the

402
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,420
summit that biden just had was she

403
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,220
in four hours

404
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,320
they did not mention the ccp virus

405
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
the covid-19 not one second

406
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
not one second

407
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,120
so i think

408
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
and we've had all the intelligence services

409
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,220
and they're saying you know

410
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,720
the ccp hasn't come forward

411
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,820
the genetic code

412
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,720
and the genomes

413
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,820
and all that genomic code

414
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,820
i think

415
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,420
that we need a full

416
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
and total

417
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,820
complete

418
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,620
boycott of

419
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,120
the beijing olympics

420
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,420
until they give access

421
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,820
to the wuhan lab

422
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,020
and all the scientists

423
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,920
and actually have to move

424
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,120
the scientists off

425
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,920
to a secure location

426
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,420
so they can be interviewed

427
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,620
by the international community

428
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,020
we've got to get to the bottom

429
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,820
of what happened in the wuhan lab

430
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,220
our responsibility

431
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,320
and you're going to see this

432
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,620
as we sweep the house

433
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,820
of representatives and take back

434
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,020
Congress in 22

435
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,420
there will be

436
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,520
formal investigations of doctor

437
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,220
fouchi

438
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,420
nih

439
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,520
and everybody in america

440
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,820
that gave money to

441
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,720
or supported

442
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,920
this gain of function

443
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
experimentation

444
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,320
in china

445
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,020
and so that is

446
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,120
on our responsibility

447
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,220
is going to be a major part

448
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
of our campaign

449
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,620
in going and sweeping

450
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,520
the house of representatives

451
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
the american people are

452
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,020
furious at tony fouchi

453
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
they are furious that nih

454
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
finance this gain of

455
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,620
function experimentation

456
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,220
that was too dangerous

457
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
to do in america

458
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,120
but it was okay to do in china

459
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,520
let's just understand

460
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
what fouchi did

461
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,520
experiments on these viruses

462
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,220
that were considered too dangerous

463
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,820
in the united states

464
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,920
but it's okay to do it in china

465
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,720
it's because of escapes

466
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,120
on the chinese people who cares

467
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,520
that's the callidness

468
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
of fouchi

469
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,320
and all the criminals

470
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,020
and that's what they are

471
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,720
the criminals

472
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,820
in nih and naid

473
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,620
that gave money to peter dasik

474
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,920
and all these other criminals

475
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,320
that allowed this

476
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,020
unsupervised

477
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,920
experimentation to be going on

478
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
in the wuhan lab

479
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
and other labs

480
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,020
that could escape

481
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,320
and basically

482
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,520
crush

483
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,320
the city of wuhan

484
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,620
crush ube province

485
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
and the chinese people

486
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,820
so we will commit

487
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,620
that once we win the house

488
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,720
in november 22

489
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,120
the formal investigations

490
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,820
to get to the bottom of what happened

491
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,220
but i'm calling on

492
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,420
all the nations of the world

493
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
should boycott

494
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,320
the beijing olympics

495
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,320
to force the regime

496
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,920
to turn over

497
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
and give full access

498
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,220
to wuhan

499
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,520
also look

500
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,620
miles has been very adamant

501
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
about the vaccine

502
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,820
i think he's the number one person

503
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,720
in the world talking about

504
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,420
the dangers of the vaccines

505
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,820
that are not thought through

506
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,920
and kind of put together

507
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,920
also about what other

508
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
viruses could come out of

509
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,320
the pla labs in ccp

510
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,920
what else are they working on

511
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
what other gain of function

512
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,020
experimentations

513
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,020
we have no idea

514
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,120
all we take is the

515
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,620
word of the ccp in the pla

516
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,420
you can't do that

517
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,220
that's ridiculous

518
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,320
look what happened on

519
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,120
in wuhan

520
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,520
so no this is

521
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
so our responsibility

522
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,020
what we can control

523
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,120
and manage will be

524
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,520
the house of representatives

525
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,820
in formal investigations

526
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,120
which are guarantee you

527
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,120
will happen

528
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
you see ran paul

529
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,420
you see jim jordan

530
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,820
i mean every day in congress

531
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,920
it is hot talking

532
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,820
hot talking

533
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,120
questions of Fauci

534
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,420
once we take control

535
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,320
you'll see that

536
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,620
and i think that'll be a huge

537
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,220
game changer

538
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,420
and the basic question

539
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
that we will have is

540
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
why is it too dangerous

541
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
to do in america

542
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,120
around the universities

543
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
in north carolina

544
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,820
in texas and all these places

545
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,220
if if it's too dangerous

546
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,120
to do in america

547
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,420
why did you fund it

548
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,720
to be done in china

549
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,220
which is less supervised

550
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,820
right less supervising

551
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,320
with the pla and open

552
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,520
bioweapons program

553
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
why was it okay for you to give

554
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
american taxpayer dollars

555
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,620
and american support

556
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,520
to the pla

557
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,220
and to the chinese communist party

558
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,420
understanding

559
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,320
how little value

560
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,420
they put in the lives

561
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,620
of the chinese people

562
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,520
and allow that to happen

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,520
in a major city like wuhan

564
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,820
that's 40 percent bigger than

565
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,420
new york city

566
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,520
the city we sit in today

567
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,220
it's absurd

568
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
it's an obscenity

569
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,320
and we're going to get to the

570
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,620
bottom of it of that

571
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,320
i promise you

572
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,620
the whistleblower movement

573
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,620

674
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,620
不可能

675
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
最后房峰辉被抓了

676
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
房峰辉被抓之前

677
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,220

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,120
当时就说了话

689
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,920
而且是房峰辉

690
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,420
当时就给美国说

691
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,320
中共的计划要在中东

692
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,520
建多个军事基地

693
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,320
You know it's general fantasy

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,620
C.P.R.A.

695
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,520

696
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,820

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,520
Iran in Saudi

698
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,620
and Qatar

699
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,220
maybe including UAE

700
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,720

701
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,820

Do you remember

703
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
这都是2017年发生的事情

704
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,420
今天班同先生把我料给放了啊

705
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,220
到时候我跟CIA

706
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,120
今天我跟对手

也所有移动的武器

713
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,920
这都是当时房峰辉

714
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,620
还有军队的人告诉我的

715
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,820
今天直播了很多中共高官啊

716
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,220
你们都别搞错了啊

717
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,420
是你们的人卖掉了你们

718
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
不是UAE也不是郭文贵

719
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,820
穆兰你要抓紧把这段翻译字幕加出来啊

720
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,520
要不然要搞好大的误会

721
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,620
因为UAE

722
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,120
我把UAE给爆了

723
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,520
可不是我是UAE爆了

724
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
是解放军的

725
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,420
跟他们的把他们给卖了

726
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,220
所以你可以看那个报道就看得出来

727
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,720
所以戴河老师你继续问吧

728
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,620
to the world to the

729
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,720
you know the

730
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,920
whole population in the world

731
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,720
as the vaccine

732
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,420
the mandate vaccine

733
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,420
and

734
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,520
say this is the new form of the war

735
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,120
and the vaccine and people a lot of people

736
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,620
because they don't know the truth

737
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,220
they welcome the vaccine

738
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,620
and they are

739
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,720
they are

740
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,120
actually they they they want to have the vaccination

741
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,820
including some of my very close friends

742
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,020
and the they are

743
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,420
actually they are waiting for the booster

744
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,320
and after booster and after

745
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
and the booster

746
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
so what do you think

747
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,020
because the United States is the you know

748
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,920
it's the most important country in the vaccination

749
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,320
that that regard

750
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,920
so what do you think how soon it will start

751
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,120
you know for the sake of your the populism

752
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,620
you know to save the world

753
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,520
the save the people like people know the truth

754
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
that's the very big

755
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,320
you know the the most important

756
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,920
thing in the world look I think this

757
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,420
this is getting to be a major political issue here

758
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,120
and it's going to be huge in 22 and 24

759
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,820
I'm not anti-vax

760
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,120
but I'm vaccine hesitant when it comes to the CCP virus

761
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,120
I've taken many vaccines

762
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,620
in the Navy to go to Asia

763
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,420
and go the South China Sea in the Middle East

764
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,820
we had to take vaccines

765
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,820
very hesitant about this vaccine

766
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,720
for simple reasons

767
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,520
I don't think

768
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,420
the information has been fully out there

769
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
I think it's too quick

770
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,120
and I don't think the testing is there

771
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,020
and it's very confusing

772
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,820
I also have seen

773
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,820
and personally because of

774
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Miles' help

775
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,720
both my sister and brother

776
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,320
had the had the CCP virus

777
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,420
and because Miles got ivermectin

778
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,020
and hydroxychloroquine

779
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
they got better

780
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,220
without taking the vaccine

781
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,720
now they have natural immunity

782
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
so I think this is a huge

783
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,520
a huge issue here in America

784
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,220
particularly since

785
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,420
many from Dr. Malone to Dr. Zelenko

786
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
many people came out

787
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Dr. Peter Navarro

788
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,120
Navarro was one of the people that worked on

789
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
getting the vaccine

790
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
in the Trump administration to where it is today

791
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,620
but he's sitting there going

792
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,020
he hasn't taken the vaccine

793
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:53,920
right

794
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,020
and he's a big believer in therapeutics

795
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,920
so I think this is only going to get to be a bigger

796
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,620
and bigger issue

797
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,220
and here's what I think is going to drive it

798
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Austria

799
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,320
has

800
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
deemed that every citizen

801
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,320
will be vaccine

802
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,820
on February 1st

803
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,120
to me that's a total game changer

804
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,920
it's even worse than Australia

805
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
and I think that's going to bring this up

806
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
as a major political issue

807
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
and I think it is

808
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,820
you know as long as they don't address natural immunity

809
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
as long as they don't address herd immunity

810
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,520
as long as they don't really address

811
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,720
the therapeutics

812
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,020
and particularly the prophylactic therapeutics

813
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,220
right and also ivermectin

814
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,520
and as long as they don't look into

815
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
why Africa

816
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
which has the

817
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,420
worst public health

818
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,520
services in the world

819
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,220
why the virus

820
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
has not caught on in Africa

821
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,920
right

822
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,120
is it because of

823
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,920
vitamin D

824
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,020
is it because of

825
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,420
zinc is it because of

826
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,320
some of these

827
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,520
vitamins that boost the immune system

828
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,120
is it because of the fresh air

829
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,520
we got it

830
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,020
we have to get to the bottom of all that

831
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,620
and I think

832
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,620
right now the continual pushing

833
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,620
by the pharmaceutical companies

834
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
with someone who's a known liar

835
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,020
is Tony Fauci

836
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,920
right

837
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,220
I think this is only going to get to be a bigger

838
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,820
and bigger issue

839
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,120
it's not going to get a smaller issue

840
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,420
it's going to get to be a bigger issue

841
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,220
谢谢

842
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:13,820
小新

843
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,620
刚才老师问的问题呢

844
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,220
就是说现在这个疫苗

845
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,820
这个情况是一个新型的战争

846
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,420
那是个时候什么时候可以结束

847
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,920
那班农先生说

848
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,120
第一他不是反疫苗

849
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
而是他对ccp病毒的疫苗

850
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,020
持一个怀疑的态度

851
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,420
他说主要有以下几个原因

852
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,920
第一个呢是信息的不透明

853
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,420
第二个呢是信息太快

854
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,220
就知道了太快这么短时间

855
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,520
知道说疫苗不可信

856
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,220
第三个呢是文贵先生的帮忙

857
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
就是他的弟弟和妹妹得病了以后

858
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,620
都是因为吃枪捋盔和

859
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,520
意味均速好了

860
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,620
有了自然的免疫

861
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,020
他说在这个媒体没有谈论群体免疫

862
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,120
自然免疫还有预防性治疗性药物

863
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,820
然后也为什么不说非洲这么穷

864
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
没有医药的地方

865
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,020
他们没有严重的疫情

866
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,520
在这之前他都不会

867
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,720
他觉得这个还有很多工作要做

868
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,620
然后他也提到了这个奥地利

869
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,620
说说所有人必须在2月1日

870
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
之前打疫苗

871
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,820
这也现在也变成了一个政治问题

872
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,820
嗯好谢谢

873
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
好的谢谢啊

874
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,420
那我们后面卡丽西

875
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
班农先生一个问题

876
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,420
呃我们知道美国的政权很多

877
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
都是被重度的蓝金黄

878
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,420
呃那么班农先生呃是什么原因

879
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,720
呃能够相信我们的文贵先生

880
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,520
并且和我们文贵先生一起来灭共的

881
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
这是第一个问题

882
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,020
那么第二个问题呢我就想问一下

883
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,220
呃我们现在呃已经建立了我们新中国联邦

884
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,820
已经建立了我们的货币体系

885
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,020
以及我们呃所有的新中国联邦的人

886
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,320
那么接下来可能因为中共病毒

887
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,020
呃会导致我们中

888
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,620
呃中国人在海外

889
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,920
有一些呃这种人身的安全

890
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,120
可能是有些排华事件的发生

891
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,520
那么班农先生

892
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,420
呃会给我们新中国联邦的国防有哪些建议

893
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,220
好谢谢

894
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,220
好嗯

895
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,020
好

896
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,820
所以呃这个问题是

897
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,920
呃现在美国的政治人员

898
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,420
大部分都是被中共联邦的

899
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,320
呃所以第一个问题是

900
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,020
你为什么要相信Miles

901
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,520
然后就把中共联邦

902
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
和所有中国人一起来灭共

903
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,420
谢谢

904
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,720
呃非常简单

905
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,820
我认为当他第一次来

906
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,220
呃

907
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,720
去西方的警告

908
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,520
去西方的警告

909
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,120
然后

910
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,220
所有人

911
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,820
想要阻挡他

912
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,420
全都在跟中共联邦合作

913
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,720
所有的所有的呃

914
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
所有的美国人

915
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,180
都跟你们也是顺利

916
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
都跟他们合作

917
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,120
呃然后所有中国人

918
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,520
通常是得和中共联邦

这就是宗教的一切

920
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
所以全� sia公司

921
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,980
特数呃他们

922
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,720

哥怎么回事

926
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320

928
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,020
啊

929
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,780

那么大

931
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,280
agrees

932
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
我問他為什麼他會在這裡做

933
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
他回答說因為大使叫了一聲

934
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,280
他告訴我們警察要關掉

935
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
我回答他為什麼要關掉

936
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
美國的聲音應該是

937
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
為了宣傳自由和民主

938
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,280
在俄羅斯、東歐、中國

939
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
我回答他為什麼要關掉

940
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
大使的聲音

941
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
他就抱怨

942
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
只要是真實

943
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
他們回答說

944
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
他回答說

945
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
很出乎意見

946
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
我回答他很出乎意見

947
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
他回答說

948
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
大使叫了一聲

949
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
他回答說

950
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
這是金錢和影響

951
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
是非常糟糕的

952
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
是中國人所偷的

953
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
所有人都被關注

954
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
他就說

955
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,280
我們要去大使

956
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,280
我們要去大使

957
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
那是2017年4月

958
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
整個大使都被關注

959
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
今天非常糟糕

960
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,280
中國人損失了10億

961
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
他對H&A的所有說法

962
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
包括警告

963
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
他們要殺死大使

964
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,280
大使終於跌倒了

965
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
在法國的阿比

966
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
全部都是謊言

967
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
他們都誣衊了

968
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Miles和Miles都誣衊了他們

969
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
他們都把衣服掉了

970
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
然後跑掉了

971
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
如果從每個方面來看

972
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
不管是金融損壞

973
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
或者是中共病毒

974
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
或者是香港

975
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
所有事情

976
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
他所說的

977
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
在多個月以來

978
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
甚至多年以來

979
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
都是真實的

980
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,280
那些反對他的人

981
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
總是跟制裁有關

982
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
所以看起來很簡單

983
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
在某個方面

984
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Miles是完美的

985
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
我的是完美的

986
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
川普是完美的

987
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
我們都沒有完美的

988
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
但他所說的

989
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,280
並且警告了CCP

990
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
不僅是中國人

991
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
還有美國人

992
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
如果我們早前

993
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,280
接受他的警告

994
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
我們不會有這個病毒

995
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
在美國這裏

996
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
做了這麼多的破壞

997
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
殺了這麼多人

998
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
離開了紐約城市

999
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
成了瘋狂

1000
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
破壞了美國的經濟

1001
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
把我們責罰

1002
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
讓他用世代來賠償

1003
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
這只是美國

1004
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
看看中國所造的

1005
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
武漢的破壞

1006
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
渡海的破壞

1007
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,280
整個中國的經濟破壞

1008
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
如果我們把Miles的警告

1009
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
放在心裏

1010
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
所以對我來說

1011
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
看著別人的說話

1012
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
看著他們的做法

1013
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
看著他們的說話

1014
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
看著他們的說話

1015
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
看著他們的說話

1016
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
看著他們的說話

1017
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
看著他們的說話

1018
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
我認為他的追蹤人員

1019
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
做得很好

1020
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
如果世界早前

1021
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
接受他的警告

1022
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
我們會在今天

1023
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
處於非常不同的情況下

1024
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
OK

1025
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
班農先生回答了一個問題

1026
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
他說其實最關鍵的

1027
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
就是聽他說的

1028
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
他警告的現在都已經成真了

1029
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
他舉了一個具體的例子

1030
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
就是當時

1031
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
這個VOA斷播的事件

1032
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
然後他就非常的好奇

1033
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
他問他們說

1034
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
為什麼要關VOA

1035
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
他們說以前關過嗎

1036
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
說從來沒有

1037
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
這是歷史上的第一次

1038
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
然後他們說為什麼要關

1039
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
是因為中國大使館

1040
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
打電話過來

1041
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
然後那個班農先生就問

1042
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
那為什麼我們要在乎

1043
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
這個大使館打過來

1044
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
我們就要關停這個節目

1045
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
然後他們回答說

1046
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
因為很有爭議

1047
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
然後呢接下來

1048
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
這個班農先生

1049
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
就會進行一個調查

1050
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
說我們要查查這個海航

1051
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
那現在我們看

1052
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
三年以後海航已經倒閉了

1053
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
連海航的董事長王健

1054
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
已經去世了

1055
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
就是我們看

1056
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
不光是他說的

1057
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
還有他做的

1058
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
一步一步都已經成真了

1059
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
就反對文貴先生的人

1060
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
都是和中共有關係

1061
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
對好謝謝

1062
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
好感謝

1063
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,280
接下來我們請安紅女士

1064
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
問班農先生問題

1065
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
謝謝

1066
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
謝謝

1067
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
你好

1068
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
我是班農先生

1069
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
還有一個問題

1070
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
我知道你提到行動

1071
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,280
三年前的比較

1072
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
三年前

1073
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,280
現在我們有海航系統

1074
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,280
我們也有GNews和JTV

1075
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
我們也有

1076
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
超過二十多名海馬拉雅農家

1077
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
所以從你的角度

1078
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
我們要做什麼

1079
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
直到我們知道

1080
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
疫情的真相

1081
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
我們知道CCP在做什麼

1082
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
我們已經知道所有事情

1083
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
所以我們要做什麼

1084
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
例如

1085
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
我的隊伍在澳洲

1086
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
特別是澳洲

1087
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
之前是CCP的第一個國家

1088
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
甚至是Scomo

1089
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
現在

1090
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,280
他們都在尋找真相

1091
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
但現在完全改變了

1092
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
他們都在推動大家

1093
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
去接種疫苗

1094
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
他們甚至說沒有接種

1095
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
沒有工作

1096
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
但我知道

1097
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,280
最近的改變

1098
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
因為很多事情都發生了

1099
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
所以我們要做什麼

1100
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
在接下來的步驟上

1101
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
謝謝

1102
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
今天我們在做什麼

1103
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
先想一下

1104
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
如果我們沒有GNews、JTV、Getter

1105
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
我們會在哪裏

1106
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
會變成遊戲結束

1107
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
這就是

1108
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
中國國家的派對

1109
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
如果我們看看

1110
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
免禁的戰爭

1111
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
資訊、虛擬戰爭

1112
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
經濟戰爭和經濟戰爭

1113
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
我們很快地

1114
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
進入了經濟戰爭

1115
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
在南中國海

1116
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
在台灣

1117
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
還有在東北的

1118
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
印度省

1119
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
對付CCP

1120
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
但是

1121
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
我們仍然可以

1122
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,280
在資訊、虛擬戰爭和經濟戰爭

1123
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
他們已經充分地

1124
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
在世界各地進行戰爭

1125
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
其中一部分是

1126
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
在CCP病毒中的

1127
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,280
資訊和虛擬戰爭

1128
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,280
所以我們必須繼續戰鬥

1129
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
今天你們所做的

1130
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
是對於資訊和虛擬戰爭

1131
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
的大部分

1132
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1133
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1134
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1135
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1136
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1137
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1138
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1139
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1140
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1141
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1142
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1143
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1144
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1145
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1146
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1147
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1148
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1149
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1150
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1151
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
我們必須繼續戰鬥

1152
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
