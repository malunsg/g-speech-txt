在法庭上?我以為他們會把我們放在法庭上,你不覺得嗎?

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
不

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
你不覺得嗎?

84
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
不

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
你不覺得他們會把我們放在法庭上?

86
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
不,100%

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
我們有超過工作

88

100%

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
我們不想被放在法庭上

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
因為他們會被放在法庭上?

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
不,100%

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
我們有100個律師給我們的意見

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
美國人總是為了準備超級戰爭

97
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
我們可以準備,但我們不可以停止

98
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
這就是美國人

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
謝謝

100
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
我剛才說的,我就說這個,就模擬這個,是吧?

101
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
人家就幹這事情,當時就是這事,就給你整的

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
遍地櫻花,無處不在,對不對?

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
那就是牛,你懂嗎?

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
離開櫻花團以後,櫻花團就不在了

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
那就是牛,你懂嗎?

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
離開櫻花團以後,櫻花團就不在了

107
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
那就是牛,你懂嗎?

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
離開櫻花團以後,櫻花團就不在了

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
離開櫻花團以後,櫻花團就內鬥

110
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
天天就東加長西加短,沒幹過這種事

111
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
然後這一段好了,馬拉多納我看看勇氣,上來了

任何戰友申請加入蓋特還有記錄團隊的

115
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
如果哪個農場給耽誤了,後果很嚴重

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
你別讓大家都失去這個機會,這是不可以的

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
維珍不破小蜜蜂,聖誕,河夜

118

當然你也能把時間放在後面

128
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
那是很大的

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
你還要計算?

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
不是我計算

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
我只是在哭

135
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
拜託

136
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
我只能說我打敗了Miles

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
我需要我的小勝利

138
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
我的小勝利

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
你第一次打敗我

140
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
對

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
你第一次打敗我

你第一次打敗我

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
你第一次打敗我

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
你只是想讓別人感到不舒服

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
讓你的粉絲感到不舒服

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Amazing

210
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
我们的翻译什么时候上

211
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
那个

212
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
不是

213
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
我们所有的语都要上翻译

214
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
原来不上现在要上

215
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
但只是有四个语言还要吗

216
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
就是

217
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
是吧

218
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
都上了就翻译的

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
就是一点击翻译软件

220
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
只是说

221
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
语言上就像你

222
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
我们啥时候上

223
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
加上不就完了吗

224
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
为什么不可以呢

225
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
等你

226
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
咱是原来故意不让上

227
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
不是你没这个本事

228
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
可以加上的

229
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
你要保证他那个

230
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
比如说

231
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
他就加上Google Translate就行

232
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
有时候

233
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
保证就是

234
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
一句话就是

235
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
不然的话每个人点一次

236
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
收

237
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
N倍的钱

238
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
在经济上说

239
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
那你就要点一次吗

240
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
点一次

241
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
多写一次

242
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
点一次是我保存的

243
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
你现在点我去使用

244
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
所以你必须要写一些东西

245
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
就是你啥时候写好呢

246
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
我可以把它

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
调高一点

248
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200

249
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200

您好

267
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
如果有人说

268
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
您知道

269
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
我们失去

270
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,000
这些资料完全是假的

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
这些资料是假的

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
减少了

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
不,我查了研究员,他说

274
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
这太疯狂了,这太低级了

275
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
这就是CCP

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
这就是好,这是真实的

277
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,000
这些资料是装在盒子里的

278
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
CCP的五毛三十二

279
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
肩膀肌肌肌的

280
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
相机视频

281
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
这太低级了

282
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
这是什么意思

283
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,000
我们不是组织人

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
我们不是组织人,对吗

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We know everything

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,200
What you thought of this

287
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,600
刚才郝海东先生

288
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,000
还有个超影妹妹

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
人家放了

290
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
人家刚认证完

291
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
共产党就派了五毛

292
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
就给人家下面放了一些裸体的相

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
郝海东又不是处男

294
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
你放这干啥

295
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
你说你共产党你low了啥什么

296
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,200
你们不要脸

297
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
你看他盖车

298
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
你干不歪了

299
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
你就玩这下三万

300
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,800
你说这个共产党又不要脸到什么程度

301
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
你就是

302
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,000
你能想象到一个国家

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,400
就这么low的水平来对付一个

304
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
我们一个平民老百姓

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
对吧

306
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
简直是了

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,800
I really don't know why

308
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Only 1.1.5K

309
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
You think the 8K

310
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
Really embarrassing

311
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Miles 郭文贵

312
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Cousin

313
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
It's so small

314
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
兄弟姐妹们

315
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
我们今天呢

316
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
今天在这直播呢

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
这个是首先一个啊

318
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,600
我们在试一个功能

319
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
就是未来的盖车

320
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
我们要直播

321
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So today we are try

322
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,400
We broadcast

323
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
We try the new technology in another country

324
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
We have a separate team

325
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Are we just now on GTV

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,800
We are on Getter

327
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
GTV and Getter

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We are the same

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,200
So this is the first live stream on Getter yet

330
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is where we can

332
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
So we'll be known in history

333
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah

334
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
The very first time on Getter live

335
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,400
Yeah

336
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
And tomorrow we're going to do War Room live

337
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Yeah

338
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
We need to do the War Room live

339
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
So we are now is the use of the third party

340
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,600
You know some technology

341
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
After 2 months 3 months

342
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,200
We are always the code by us

343
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
So only you know Twitter

344
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Not broadcast

345
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Right

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
It's too bad

347
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,400
We are in the live stream

348
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Broadcast

349
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,800
Also we have a lot of technology

350
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,200
You can edit with you

351
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
And more fast

352
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
And everybody can maybe

353
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Later we hope

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
3 minutes

355
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
5 minutes or somebody

356
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
We have like a longer

357
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Like a longer almost like Tiktok right on

358
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Yeah Tiktok

359
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
No Tiktok is a very short time

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
Short and longer

361
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Yeah it's very bad

362
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Tiktok is nothing

363
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,200
Seriously

364
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,600
It's nothing

365
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,400
Young kids

366
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
This is called kill timing

367
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
What is kill timing

368
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,400
Kill time

369
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah sure you can't do that

370
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
You just waste your life

371
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,600
Yeah waste your life

372
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
And it's dangerous

373
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
If somebody try to do this

374
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Try to do this over the you know

375
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Over the top

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Capable

377
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Capable

378
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
They try to show off

379
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
They try to show off

380
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
What will happen no money

381
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
So I talked to Jason before

382
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
We need to buy maybe 100 car

383
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
And you know it's the 150

384
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
You know the car

385
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
American people like the big car park

386
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,400
The big F100

387
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
150

388
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600

389
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
150

390
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
That's the one you drive out in

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
And when you're a cowboy

392
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Out in the mountain stage right

393
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,400

00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
My wife always use the car

397
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Never use it all the time

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
That F100 and F150

399
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800

400
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,600

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
We need to buy the 100 car

403
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600

404
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
很多人不愿意嫁给你

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
犯罪的男人

485
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
没有机会

486
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
没有机会

487
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
父母说没有机会

488
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
抓住他

489
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
抓住他

490
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
我们山东女孩长得很漂亮

很凶猛

495
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
那边还有两杯咖啡呢好像

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
拿过来

497
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
在那还有呢吗?

498
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
你看,还有咖啡吗?

499
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
我喜欢一个

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
给他来个热的

501
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
我那就是还用了些马卡尔就回来了

502
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
今天给大家发了一些新消息

503
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
第二次最大的传播

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
最大的运作是从巴西

505
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,960
记得,Miles我们还剩下四五天

506
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
因为工程队有很多工作

507
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
我们四五天之内在英国

508
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
所以运作和运作都在英国

509
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
记得

510
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
我认为

511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
巴西是全世界最多的推特市场

512
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
所以我们预期

513
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,960
波尔森尔罗的通讯指挥

514
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
和他的孙子今天参与

515
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
我们就要

516
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
如果他父母不参与

517
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
我认为他会参与

518
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
因为他是总裁

519
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
我们可以给他一辆车

520
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
一辆车

521
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
那是免费的

522
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
法律上

523
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
没有问题

524
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
我认为

525
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
他们将会

526
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
这很重要

527
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
下个礼拜

528
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
一年以后

529
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
不止这一年

530
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
下个礼拜

531
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
在巴西会有个选举

532
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
那将会有

533
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
根据理论来说

534
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
有一个共产党人

535
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Lula

536
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
对,Lula

537
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
和

538
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
C.C.P

539
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
所以Lula

540
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
C.C.P的选举

541
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
和巴尔森尔罗

542
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Lula

543
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
我认为

544
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
他会在中国

545
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
七次

546
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
在中国

547
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
对

548
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
在Pangu

549
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
在巴西

550
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
在香港

551
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
在Pangu

552
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
我认为

553
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
他会在Pangu

554
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
在Pangu

555
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
他会去中国

556
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
做生意

557
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
生意很大

558
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
油生意

559
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
農夫生意

560
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
農夫生意

561
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
農夫生意

562
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
很大

563
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
農夫生意

564
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
農夫生意

565
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
所以在巴西

566
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
这些国家

567
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
我认为

568
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
C.C.P

569
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
是专注于

570
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
在巴西

571
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
对

572
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
和Lula

573
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
对

574
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
所以这将会

575
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
是一个大战

576
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
所以Getter

577
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
将会是

578
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
这么重要的一个战略

579
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
我认为

580
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Lula

581
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
在巴西

582
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
在巴西

583
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
在巴西

584
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
在巴西

585
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,960
这就是

586
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
巴西当年

587
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
就是这个

588
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
这个

589
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
这个

590
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Luke

591
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
给我们安排了几台

592
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
奔驰的房车

593
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
让我用一星期

594
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
给我们安排了几台奔驰的房车

595
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
让我用一星期

596
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,960
奔驰防弹车,都原厂的还是,咔咔叨叨,到处是枪杀案

597
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,960
San Paulo,San Paulo,San Paulo is an unsafe area, but San Paulo food is beautiful

598
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,960
I go to the one club, the club is very famous

599
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:35,960
那个叫什么,水波罗,水波罗业主会最有名的,the night club

600
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Wow, the girls are dancing here, beautiful

601
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,960
I said wow, so it looks beautiful, but you go outside, some areas are too poor, very bad

602
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Lots of crime, same time as 30 years ago

603
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,960
I thought you told me you didn't go to night clubs, all you did was work

604
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Oh really, but sometimes you know

605
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
In your wild younger days, before you became just all work

606
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,960
You know, this is my life, I, what is this?

607
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Ten years

608
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Only this?

609
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah, ten, ten years in there

610
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Oh, what is the difference?

611
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Ten years, chicken?

612
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Hot, what is the inside?

613
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
So much chicken

614
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Which one chicken?

615
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Yeah, there's chicken and ham

616
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Chicken and this?

617
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
They all live with chicken, ham

618
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
What is this?

619
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
They all got different names, so that's

620
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
What is this?

621
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
That's chicken, bacon

622
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Chicken, bacon, huh?

623
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
What is this?

624
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Hold on

625
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
This is chicken capri

626
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
This is chicken?

627
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Chicken, yeah

628
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,960
This is chicken and bacon

629
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Oh, thank you so much

630
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
It's more hot

631
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay, thank you

632
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Do you have this side?

633
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
On the other side, you want me to take it?

634
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah, just give them

635
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Okay, yeah

636
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Let's wait till we finish broadcasting

637
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
No, we can eat it here

638
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
What do you want?

639
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
What do you like?

640
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
What do you got?

641
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Chicken?

642
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
What's that?

643
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
I'll take this

644
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
What is this?

645
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Chicken capri, I'll take this

646
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Okay

647
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
You got this for the other guys

648
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
You want me to deliver them?

649
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
No, we eat

650
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
What is this?

651
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
You got this for the other guys

652
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
You want me to deliver them?

653
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,960
No, we eat

654
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I've never eaten on a live broadcast before

655
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I've always been eating at the broke hearts

656
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Right

657
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Wow

658
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Delicious

659
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,960
We're eating because we're here 24 hours a day

660
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
I love that background

661
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,960
This is one of the most beautiful views of Central Park

662
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Beautiful

663
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Miles and I, years ago

664
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Back in 2018, like 3 or 4 years ago

665
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Had the studio

666
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
That was right up from the straight Netherlands

667
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
In the next office building

668
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,960
And we had the view of the lower end of the park

669
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Over on the other side

670
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,960
This one is deep

671
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
We had that one

672
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,960
But we had the beautiful view of all the buildings on Central Park South

673
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,960
We are eating

674
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,960
We went over 1 million people on the site

675
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Fund Getter signed up today

676
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Which is huge

677
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
In 24 hours

678
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I think more

679
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I think brother

680
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Everything is beautiful

681
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Just taste

682
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Tomorrow is the big day

683
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Also we cleaned up

684
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
The issues with Google

685
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,960
So there's no more Google

686
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
What's up

687
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Did you bring it back?

688
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,960
No more Google

689
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Where did you get this?

690
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Give it to them

691
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Don't go buy it again

692
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960
Thank you

693
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Give it to them

694
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Don't buy it again

695
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
You want to eat

696
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
You want to stay

697
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Take care of yourself first

698
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
No one is in danger

699
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Eat first

700
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
You eat first

701
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,960
And of course the biggest news is Mbz

702
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Huge news

703
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
You basically had

704
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I need to try this one brother

705
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,960
This one is beautiful

706
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Thank you

707
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Oh good

708
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,960
This one is delicious

709
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,960
This one is delicious

710
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,960
You try this one

711
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I think you will definitely like this one

712
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Mbz is a drawing

713
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
That's the big big big big

714
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Mbz is CCT

715
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Remember

716
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
One of the most important points you brought up yesterday

717
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
That we talked about

718
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Not one head of state

719
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Attended the 100th anniversary

720
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,960
That's a huge loss of face

721
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
It's far from what we can do with Russia and Putin

722
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Putin said we cannot draw in this

723
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
We will send a video

724
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
No

725
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,960
It's June 1st

726
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I understand it's great

727
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,960
We want to be far from this

728
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
We want to be far personally from this

729
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Personally not from the country of Russia

730
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Not from the country

731
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Not official

732
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,960
You see you got Central Park

733
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
That's so beautiful

734
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
You got Central Park West

735
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Right up there

736
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Very beautiful

737
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Beautiful

738
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Beautiful

739
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,960
You've never really lived in the west side

740
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Everything is on the east side

741
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Well

742
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Also this office is so centrally located

743
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
This area is almost number one

744
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Convenient area

745
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Only here have the shop

746
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Nighty famous shop

747
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
One hundred seventy restaurants

748
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
In the Time Warner they have

749
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,960
The sixteen best restaurants in the world

750
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Yes

751
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
在对面的那个楼里面

752
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
有这个餐厅

753
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
当年的Time Warner发展的

754
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
十六个世界最好的餐厅

755
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Sushi places

756
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Nabu

757
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
No Nabu

758
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Nabu is too low

759
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Happy

760
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Look at that

761
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
快吃了三分钟

762
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
拿来

763
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
你再吃一个吗

764
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
没有我吃过

765
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
刚刚吃过

766
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
你吃什么呀

767
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
你吃什么

768
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,960
We get him off the beach from the pool

769
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
This is how they

770
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
The Japanese restaurant is number one

771
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Nabu is too low

772
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Nabu is too low

773
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
I thought it was supposed to be

774
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Number one

775
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Farmers eat the food in those

776
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
That's the farmer side

777
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,960
That's for Danilo and Harvey Weinstein

778
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I thought it was

779
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Too expensive

780
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
That's the farmer side

781
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,960
That's for Danilo and Harvey Weinstein

782
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
I thought it was

783
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Too expensive

784
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm the farmer

785
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I eat just the lower food

786
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
That's my food

787
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
I'm the farmer

788
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Chinese farmer

789
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
You can't eat sushi

790
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I can't eat it

791
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
You can't eat it

792
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
嗯

793
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
吃不饿

794
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,960
现在典型吃不饿

795
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
So Nabu is not

796
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Nabu is too low

797
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm eating

798
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
You eat too easy

799
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
What's the number one sushi place then

800
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Here

801
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Safe the floor

802
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
The sixth floor

803
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm a winner

804
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
这个里面最好的餐厅

805
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
This one

806
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Here

807
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I can watch

808
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
就这里

809
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm always eating here

810
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Do you think that's the best sushi in New York

811
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Yeah

812
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
It's expensive

813
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Best sushi in New York

814
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
One in Soho

815
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
One in the 34th street

816
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,960
34th street on the third

817
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,960
It's really traditional food

818
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Super

819
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Traditional Japanese

820
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
It's real Japanese

821
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
But no celebrities

822
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
The problem with these is Nabu

823
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
All the celebrities

824
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
But they don't know

825
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
All the celebrities

826
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
They don't know quality

827
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
China found the food

828
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Nabu

829
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
The same as Chinese food here in town

830
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Where the celebrities go is not

831
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
It's not the best

832
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,960
What would then be the best Chinese in New York

833
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Lot of it not

834
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Lot of great

835
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Lots

836
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Lots

837
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
真的很多中国餐厅特别好

838
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
特别好

839
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
好玩

840
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
This is what we

841
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
We call it

842
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
We call it

843
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Next door

844
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
You work at the next door

845
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Working

846
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
I was the

847
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Oh

848
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
This is a young Chinese

849
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
You look handsome

850
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,960
English

851
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
In Chinese

852
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Positive

853
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
And they're always working out

854
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
They're always pumping

855
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
I used to

856
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Prince always looks like he just came off of a workout

857
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
I learned it from Mario

858
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
这还有还有呢这

859
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Mario is very good in trade

860
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
我看这是有个鸡的

861
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
吃一口这个

862
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
剩下你吃

863
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
你要跟我在一起

864
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
你要天天替我吃饭

865
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
知道吧

866
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
那有氧化的

867
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
我就找不见了

868
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
你不吃饱

869
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
不吃饱就找饱呗

870
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,960
你不愿意出现就不出现小伙子

871
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
不许啊

872
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960

我是在今天直播是在试一个

他们正在做

878
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
没人知道啊

879
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
只有我知道

880
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
迷你武器

科技灭供

882
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
养胖了嫁给我

883
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,960
民和农场叫文俊啊

884
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
我们都是农民啊

885
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960

他将展示CCP的人

00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
在2020年选举中有直接的参与

共产党如何使用黑客技术

泰克的美国2020年的大选

923
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,360
他同时也会邀请来自于中共的代表

00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360

他邀请了CCP的人

929
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,360
他们邀请了博士来与所有人

930
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,360
他将展示CCP的人

931
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
有直接的参与

932
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
在这些互动中

933
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,360
他们将与拜登和战略判断

934
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
在这个年度8月10号

935
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,360
11号和12号

936
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,360
麦克林德尔就是那个枕头哥先生

937
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,360
他已经邀请了中共国驻美国的大使

938
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
然后包括世界各地的这个代表

939
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,360
他会用真实的证据显示

940
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
中共国如何使用黑客技术

941
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
在2020年

942
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
透露了美国的总统大选

943
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,360
现在war room是将在这三天内

944
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,160
三天後,我們會把整個團隊從GETR到現場直播

945
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,320
展示整個體驗,展示全世界的專家

946
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,880
透過這個數據,記住這只是第二種方式

947
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,440
第一種方式就是這種舊式的偷竊

948
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
我們在抓捕這些人,他們抓捕了

949
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,280
所以,我認為總統特朗普的選舉

950
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
會被批准

951
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
並不是說會被反彈,這是很不一樣的

952
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,040
我們從來沒有發生過這樣一個法律的危機

953
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
我和Miles have talked about for many many months

954
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,760
我們正在進入一個法律的危機

955
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
因為這次選舉的批准

956
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,240
但這將會是很嚴重的

957
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:45,200
我不談美國政策
