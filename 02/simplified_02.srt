00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
齐哥好

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
班农先生好

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
能听到声音吗

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
齐哥能听到声音吗

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
还没有开麦

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
可以听到我们的声音是吧

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
可能那边声音还没调好

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
那我们先让新加进来的几位嘉宾

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
新加进来的几位嘉宾做一下介绍吧

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
老班长

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
好 齐哥好 班农先生好 各位好

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
亲爱的战友们大家好

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
今天是一个特别特别值得纪念的日子

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
我们爆料革命

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
我们爆料革命四年多以来

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
还有很多日子都值得纪念

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
而1120无一事当中最重要的一个之一

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
所以说今天我们在这里隆重的来纪念这一天

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
来分享这一路以来爆料革命的一些感受

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
我非常荣幸 谢谢

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
好 曹根

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
好的 齐哥好 班农先生好

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
亲爱的战友们好 观众朋友们好

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
我非常荣幸参加1120这个节目

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
这是应该是第二次了

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
第一次的时候每一次的1120都印象非常深刻

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
这一次非常有幸能够参与进来 谢谢

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
好 唐萍

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
全球战友们好 齐哥好 班农先生好

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
今天很激动

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
我们的法治基金法治社会到现在成立已经三周年了

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
还记得三年前

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
我是一直激动的守在手机的APP前面

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
收看这个1120的新闻发布会

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
王健之死的新闻发布会

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
而且没想到同时听到了这个消息

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
就是成立法治基金法治社会

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
所以说三年过来了

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
我觉得星星之火可以燎原

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
之前我们是没有火

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
一直这个火种是2017年文贵先生出来

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
他点起了这个火种

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
然后到了18年的1120

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
真的就是我们形成了一个这么大的灭共的联盟

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
然后我们全球有那么多的战友

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
那么一直到今天三年以后

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
到今天这把火真的是越烧越旺了

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
可以燎原了

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
谢谢大家

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
谢谢

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
好 谢谢

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
威廉王

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
七哥好 班农先生好

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
所有的战友们大家好

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
今天非常的激动能参加1120的纪念日

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
然后1120对于我来说意义也是非常大

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
当时确实是特别的震撼

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
当七哥向全世界宣告黑夜已经来临

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
然后真的是首次警告了全世界的人

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
关于共产党的黑暗

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
所以我们在现在的财富增长的同时

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
一定不要忘了我们的初心

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
我们是因为什么被吸引到不老革命

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
我们到底是为了干什么来的

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
所以这个纪念日真的是非常非常重要

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
非常感谢

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
很高参加 谢谢

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
好 谢谢威廉王

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
那我们赵英杰

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
好 七哥好 班农先生好

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
全球的战友大家好

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
很高兴今天和大家见面

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
虽然我其实参加爆料革命我们比较晚

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
王健之死这些七哥当时三年前开始爆料的时候

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
我们还不知道怎么回事呢

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
所以今天第一次这个日子和大家团聚在一起

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
谢谢

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
好 海龙先生

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
好 全球的战友们

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
七哥 班农先生大家好

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
我是非常非常欣慰幸运的

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
接过了这个班农先生的这个法治基金的主席

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
我想这是真正为中国人民

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
为老百姓在全球的唯一的这个法治基金

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
这么一个基金来去为中国人 为中国老百姓

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
班农先生经常说的这句话深深的感动我

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
我知道他是从一个美国人 外国人的一个嘴里面说出来

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
老百姓这三个字是对我们中国人多大的认可

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
多么多么的有亲切的这种感受的

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
心心相惜的这种感觉感受

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
所以在这儿都是相信爆料革命新中国联邦法治基金

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
所有在七哥创造的这个平台上

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
我们会也一定能把中国共产党就像我们在宣言里说的一样

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
八九六这个这个2020六四的时候

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
消灭中共是正义的需要

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
好 谢谢

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
好 谢谢海龙先生

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
谢谢海龙先生

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
那我们也看到了这在所有的框当中

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
除了这个文威先生和班农先生以外

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
基本上都是目前的这个法治基金

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
或者法治社会的董事或者说认知

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
那在我们看到班农先生和文威先生

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
其实创建了这个法治基金法治社会

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
我相信我记得文威先生过去有讲过

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
就是法治基金法治社会

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
一定是在我们这个中国人手上

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
或者说咱们战友手上去更更好的用好这些每一分钱

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
用到这个灭共的事业上面去

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
我想今天文威先生和班农先生看到

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
今天的法治基金法治社会的运作和合法合规的在操作

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
我相信他们也会比更更放心

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
好的 那文威先生

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
好 这个

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:57,000
我刚刚跟班农刚离开以后

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
我们俩离开这个屋就真的是

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
来上洗手间控制就一直在开会

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
开会呢 刚才开完会我到了洗手间

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
我是蹲在马桶上啊

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
边大便边换上衣

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
然后擦完屁股及时提着鞋就穿出来了

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
然后就点雪茄

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
真的一秒钟时间没有

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
班农先生每次进洗手间那边人家喊

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
出来

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
所以说我们就赶快来开会

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
人家人走了我们俩就穿到这儿来了

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
进着屋之前点着着雪茄

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
你看他们很轻松

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
真的是在高校的工作

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
而且班农先生你说他

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
跟我这样的年龄的人

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
一起跟人家开会

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
他就这样子很不容易的

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
所以说今天法治基金的时候

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
当我们谈的是兄弟姐妹们记住

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
班农先生真的是

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
用共产党的话说

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
真的是傲尽了自己的心思

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
真的是多少个不名业

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
跟我们一起1120

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
还当时建立法治社会法治基金

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
这是我跟班农先生

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
在三年前亲身经历的

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
今天又是同一个时间

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
同样的就是还是这样的辛苦的

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
他是为了我们

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
班农先生没有在法治基金

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
法治社会拿一分钱

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
而这个时候他今天想到的

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
和昨天和三年前想到的

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
真的最多中国老百姓

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
他想的最多的老百姓

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
包括我们刚才谈到的很多话题

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
就你能感受到这个外国人

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
是真的假的对咱们中国人好

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
他一想到

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
一说要能解救中国老百姓

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
他的眼睛就放光了

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
我们要赶快吧

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
行动快行动

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
班农先生在美国

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
最早跟随我说的

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
action action

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
行动行动行动

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
我们真的是大家要爱班农

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
这是why we love you

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
even you change we don't love you

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
don't be changed

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
我说你变了牛肉

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
no beef

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
今天班农先生吃饭

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
我说我要给你拍下来

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
no time eating food

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that's why

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
所以说今天我们是

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
今天午饭特别好吃

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
说实话我都没有

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
因为他的事都太大了

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
我们谈到了郝海东先生的安全

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
叶钊永女士的安全

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
我们谈到了未来新西兰需要我们的保护

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
我们谈到了澳大利亚

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
现在发生了一系列的事件

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
我们谈到了加拿大

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
现在我们知道了情报

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
会对华人什么样的威胁

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
我们谈到日本

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
什么样会对我们的威胁

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
包括在台湾香港

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
所有的都谈到这个问题

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
这都是非常非常非常重要

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
每时每刻都对我们很重要

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
我们要做一系列的决定

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
要不要做这个

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
要不要做那个

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
我们不可能什么都做到

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
但是我们要做出正确

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
这就是班农先生

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
他绝对是我们的master

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
大师姐

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
这是真的是

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
现在大家有什么要问班农的

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
请你们问吧

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
我们就先从那个老班长开始吧

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
老班长

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
老班长声音

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
好的

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
谢谢非常非常感谢班农先生

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
一路以来

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
跟我们爆料革命

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
坚定的站在一起

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
为我们法治基金的最初的创立

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
做出了最大最大的贡献

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
非常令人激动

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
作为一个美国人

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
作为一个政治家

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
影响世界的政治家

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
您对我们法治基金

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
这三年以来的工作

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
能不能跟我们

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
做一个非常非常简短的评价

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
它的意义是什么

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
谢谢班农先生

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
谁翻译

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
这边有翻译

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
声音单

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
我以为让我翻译

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
我的翻译

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
老班长说

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
谢谢班农先生

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
为我们站在一起

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
帮助我们建立法律和社会的基础

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
我们非常感谢您的努力和支持

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
在短短的时间内

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
您能够简短地说一下

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
您所做的工作

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
您所做的工作

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
您所做的工作

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
您所做的工作

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
您所做的工作

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
您所做的工作

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
您所做的工作

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
您所做的工作

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
您所做的工作

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,160
很简短地说

248
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
您所做的工作

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
您所做的工作

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
您所做的工作

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
法律和社会的法律

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
在这三年来上做过

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
谢谢

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
我觉得最重要的工作

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
是跟威士罗社会合作

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
尽可能帮助我们

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
尽可能帮助我们

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
尽可能帮助我们

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
在中国被中共制之后

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
尽可能帮助我们

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
尽可能帮助我们

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
尽可能帮助我们

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
对武汉病毒

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
尽可能帮助我们

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,740
西方的数量,人们都被消失了,

266
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,380
有被革命的灭亡,

267
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,860
为何中国人民需要法律,

268
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,500
为何他们需要被法律管治。

269
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,420
记得3年前,

270
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,520
当这个开始时,

271
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Miles和其他团队,

272
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,100
西方没有人有任何理由

273
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,880
关于那些千万人,

274
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
无论是高级电影明星,

275
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,960
或是政府人员,

276
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,600
或是老百姓,

277
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,640
被中国共产党消失了。

278
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
这几年来,

279
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,680
我认为这件事很惊人,

280
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,760
这件事是由国际法律组织做的,

281
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,240
国际法律组织,

282
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,760
在中国和香港和其他地方

283
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,280
都在帮助中国人,

284
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,560
对中共病毒的做法,

285
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,520
我认为国际法律的努力

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,800
在过去三年来,

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
我希望在这三年来,

288
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,640
就像我们在创立法律组织时期

289
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
所做的那三年来一样有效。

290
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
谢谢班农先生。

291
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
班农先生刚才说,

292
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
在过去三年中,

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
法治基金主要是以救人为主,

294
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
不管是从救人,

295
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
从中共大陆出来,

296
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
或者是给药,

297
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
主要的工作就是给西方传播真相,

298
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
就是给西方人解释,

299
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
为什么中国人会需要民主和法治,

300
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
不好意思,有点紧张,

301
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
法治和民主,

302
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
因为在三年前刚开始的时候,

303
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
其实没有西方人知道中国人在受苦,

304
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
没有人知道中国人在被消失,

305
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
所以过去的三年,

306
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
我们传播中共的真相,

307
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
真的是非常有力的一个力量。

308
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
好,谢谢。

309
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
草根,

310
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
可以用英语直接问。

311
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
好的,

312
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
我英语不好,我就用中文的。

313
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
班农先生好,

314
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
班农先生作为西方最高权力的,

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
美国总统的首席战略大师,

316
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
对我们中国人的支持,

317
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
对郭先生的支持,

318
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
可以说意义非凡,

319
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
一个西方最有影响力,最有远见著实的人,

320
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
而且是一个赢家。

321
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
班农先生之前帮助川普总统,

322
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
赢得总统,

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
现在我相信他也能帮助我们中国人获得胜利。

324
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
我有一个问题就是说,

325
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
班农先生在面对压力,

326
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
面对巨大的打击挫折的情况下,

327
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
还如何保持信心?

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
我相信这对未来我们中国人,

329
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
会非常有帮助。

330
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
谢谢。

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
谢谢草根小哥。

332
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
他说,

333
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
美国最有影响力的政治家,

334
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
或者西方国家,

335
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
你必须帮助川普,

336
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
赢得选举,

337
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
你必须帮助我们赢得我们的国家。

338
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
他的问题是,

339
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
你面对很多困难,

340
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
你如何克服它们?

341
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
你有什么建议,

342
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
或建议可以跟我们分享吗?

343
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
谢谢。

344
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
非常简单。

345
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
我来自美国的劳百姓,

346
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
我父母非常尊敬。

347
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
我父亲一百岁,

348
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
但他是一名电话公司的职员。

349
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
他们教导我,

350
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
他们教导我,

351
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
保持战争的价值。

352
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
我们是英国人,

353
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
所以我们不会停止战争。

354
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
我认为,

355
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
无论是为了帮助川普,

356
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
为了帮助川普,

357
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
赢得第一次,

358
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
或是为了帮助他,

359
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
赢得第一次,

360
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
或是为了帮助他,

361
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
赢得第二次,

362
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
赢得第二次,

363
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
或是为了帮助中国人民,

364
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
赢得第一次,

365
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
他们都很困难,

366
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
他们都很困难,

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
但如果你们被父母侵犯,

368
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
如果你们被父母侵犯,

369
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
如果你们被父母侵犯,

370
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
我们会把川普总统的总统帐号删除,

371
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
然后把总统帐号删除。

372
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
好,谢谢。

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
好,那我们下面唐萍。

374
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
我有两个问题要问。

375
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
一件事,

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
为了帮助川普,

377
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
为了帮助他,

378
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
赢得第一次,

379
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
或是为了帮助他,

380
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
赢得第一次,

381
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
或是为了帮助他,

382
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
赢得第一次,

383
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
赢得第一次,

384
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
或是为了帮助他,

385
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
在美国。

386
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
好。

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
班农先生说这个Tick Down的CCP这首歌

388
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
现在在美国全国是流行第一名的一首歌曲。

389
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
现在在美国全国是流行第一名的一首歌曲。

390
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
对。

391
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
还有我们的新歌,

392
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
H Coins To The Moon。

393
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
那个是我们的作品,

394
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
蛮漂亮的。

395
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
对。

396
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
应该很不错,我相信。

397
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Miles唱歌很难,

398
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
没有H Coins,

399
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
没有Miles唱歌,

400
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
没有Miles唱歌,

401
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
这是第一名的歌曲,

402
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
第二名的歌曲,

403
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
第三名的歌曲,

404
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
帮助我成为巨星。

405
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
没有Miles唱歌,

406
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
你们三个成为我的英雄。

407
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
非常感谢。

408
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
谢谢。

409
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
我有两个问题想问班农先生。

410
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
第一个问题就是

411
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
您看

412
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
真的是在这个早期

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
就是爆料革命的早期,

414
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
当郭先生一个人单枪匹马,

415
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
一个人抗议国的

416
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
这样的一个情况下,

417
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
当时我觉得

418
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
整个的海外的民运,

419
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
那个也是

420
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
就是很乱的,

421
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
都是乱象,

422
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
有很多的伪类,大白犬什么的。

423
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
当时是什么样的一个信念

424
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
支持你,就是坚定不移的

425
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
要去跟郭先生

426
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
在一起战斗,

427
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
然后才有了我们的

428
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
1120的这样的一个

429
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
在纽约的一个发布会。

430
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
当时你跟郭先生两个人

431
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
真的就是宣布

432
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
这个法治基金成立,

433
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
但是我们真的是欢欣鼓舞的,

434
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
所有的华人,

435
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
就是说有什么样的

436
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
这样的一个

437
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
勇气来支持你

438
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
来做这件事情,就是坚定不移的

439
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
支持文贵先生,

440
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
支持郭先生,跟他站在一起战斗。

441
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
那么你有没有想过

442
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
接下来,就是

443
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
当时有没有想过,接下来

444
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
会碰到很多很多的

445
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
构陷啊,污蔑啊,

446
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
就是很多的困难。

447
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
这是我第一个问题,然后第二个问题就是

448
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
您经常是把老百姓

449
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
中国的,中国人

450
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
就是挂在嘴边去,

451
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
那么您认为,中国人

452
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
是哪些方面

453
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
值得你这么义无反顾的

454
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
可以去,我相信你

455
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
真的是

456
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
在用你的生命,在为

457
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
中国人去争取这份民主

458
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
和自由的,所以这个是让

459
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
我们所有的战友啊,所有的华人

460
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
都特别感动的一件事情,

461
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
那么是什么力量去支持你的,

462
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
就这两个问题,谢谢。

463
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
好,谢谢小杨姐。

464
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
嗯,so in the beginning of the

465
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
movement when Miles was alone

466
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
fighting with the CCP, the

467
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Chinese movements in the US was a

468
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
mess, so what was your motivation

469
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
to stand with Miles and

470
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
what drove you to support Miles?

471
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Have you thought about the obstacles,

472
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
deformation and trouble?

473
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Thank you.

474
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Unlike anybody had come to the West,

475
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Miles

476
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
talked about things

477
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
and warned the West

478
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
about

479
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
very sophisticated, the people

480
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
had come before, don't get me wrong,

481
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
were good people, but it was the Tiananmen Square

482
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
democracy movement and

483
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
other maybe lawyers

484
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
and human rights activists, and although it was very

485
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
moving, it didn't

486
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
and people

487
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
felt for the Chinese people, it didn't

488
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
strike a chord at the high power

489
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
levels. When Miles came

490
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
over to the West,

491
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
his first warning to the West in

492
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
2017

493
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
quite shocked me, because

494
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
the level of detail and the level of

495
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
sophistication. Then when I saw

496
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
him take on H&A,

497
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
which at the time was the largest

498
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
financial company in the world, and

499
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
was supported by all of Wall Street,

500
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Bank of

501
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
America, and he was attacked, attacked,

502
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
attacked, and said

503
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
that this was a money laundering

504
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
operation, an influencing

505
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
operation that had stolen everything from

506
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
the Chinese people and was laundering it

507
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
into the West. It resonated

508
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
with me as a very sophisticated analysis

509
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
of a company, and he

510
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
was taking on, not the little guys, he

511
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
was taking on the power structure,

512
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
not just in Beijing, in America,

513
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
and calling them out.

514
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
And when they tried

515
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
to shut him up,

516
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
he sued him, he used the

517
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
courts, the rule of law in America

518
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
to go after him, and guess

519
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
what, they all, they all

520
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
stopped, they all cratered, they all said, oh, excuse

521
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
me, you know, I don't want to go to court, I don't want

522
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
to go in a court of law.

523
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
And then Miles warned about Hong Kong,

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
and then he warned about the CCP

525
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
virus, and so everything

526
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
was not at a low level, it was a very high

527
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
level, and it just wasn't pointing

528
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
to Beijing, which all the

529
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
other Chinese dissents had always pointed to Beijing.

530
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
He pointed to

531
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
America and London

532
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
and Davos

533
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
and the banks and the

534
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
hedge funds and the corporations

535
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
that were in partnership with

536
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
the CCP. And I said,

537
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
this is extraordinary. His warning to the West

538
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
is right, because remember, it's one unified

539
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
system, and the reason that

540
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
the regime in Beijing exists

541
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
is because of

542
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Wall Street and the corporations

543
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
and the political influence they've gotten by taking

544
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
the Lao Bai Jing money and funding it

545
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
to the West, and stealing it

546
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
for themselves, and making the

547
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Western banks and investment banks and hedge

548
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
funds lots of money. So you

549
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
could see the whole system, and you could see he

550
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
was attacking the heart of the system.

551
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
That's courage, right, because

552
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
that's why his life is always, that's why they've been

553
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
under pressure, because he's speaking

554
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
what we say here is truth to power,

555
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
right, truth to power.

556
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
And I admired that, and I said

557
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
if this corrupt system's

558
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
going to come down, you have to

559
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
be in partnership with people

560
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
like that who are fearless,

561
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
who have courage, because

562
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
as Churchill told us, courage

563
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
is contagious,

564
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
and courage will embolden

565
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
other people, and that's what I've seen over the last couple

566
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
of years. Have you seen how far we've

567
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
come with the foundation

568
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
of the new federal state, and the

569
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
growth of the whistleblower

570
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
movement, and the

571
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
rule of law foundation, rule of society, just

572
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
in a few years. These are now

573
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
significant institutions that are

574
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
attack, attack, attack every day

575
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
with real information. Look at

576
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
G-News, GTV, Getter, all these

577
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
institutions. This is

578
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
institutionalizing a new China

579
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
with the new Chinese,

580
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
young Chinese, and that is very

581
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
powerful. So that's why I thought Miles

582
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
was, and I understood,

583
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
every bad guy in our country was trying

584
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
to get him extradited

585
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
back to Beijing. So I said

586
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
my mother,

587
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
my mom had a very good

588
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
saying when I was

589
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
a young boy, that you can tell the quality

590
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
of a man by

591
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
who his enemies are,

592
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
right? And I looked at Miles and I said

593
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
this guy's got all the right

594
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
enemies. He's hated

595
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
by all the right people,

596
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
right? All the super bad guys

597
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
here in America and in Beijing.

598
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
And so that's why it's

599
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
and I keep telling people,

600
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
I said just look at what Miles

601
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
said at the time he said it

602
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
and look what happened. And I

603
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
say this all the time. If America

604
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
and the West

605
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
had heeded his warning

606
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
when he first came here in 2017,

607
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
the world would be in a very different position.

608
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You wouldn't have the global

609
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
chaos and anarchy of the CCP

610
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
virus, right? And who knows

611
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
what to come after that. We wouldn't be in trouble

612
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
in the South China Sea or in Taiwan,

613
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
right? The Uyghurs wouldn't be

614
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
the Uyghurs wouldn't be in

615
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
prison, right? So many of these

616
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
ills that the power structure

617
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
of the West has gone along with

618
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
and Davos has gone along

619
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
with and the World Economic Forum and the city

620
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
of London and Wall Street has all gone along

621
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
with. If we had just heeded

622
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Miles Guo's warning in 2017,

623
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
the world would be a more peaceful,

624
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
prosperous

625
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
and healthy place.

626
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Thank you, Mr.

627
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Bannon.

628
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Thank you, Mr. Bannon.

629
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

630
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.

631
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
You lost three points.

632
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Three points.

633
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Sir Steve know me as

634
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
before in the Beijing

635
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
is the Pan-Gu Olympic 2008.

636
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
So you know

637
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
a lot about, you know,

638
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Pan-Gu. So that's Pan-Gu

639
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
still in China. Only one

640
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
private developer,

641
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
real estate party in the Pan-Gu area

642
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
even now, right?

643
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Yes.

644
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
You know we have capability.

645
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
This one, right? You know before

646
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
2008.

647
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
So secondly, you need

648
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
to know we are, we talk a lot

649
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
about the China history,

650
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
global history, you know,

651
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
also the American history

652
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
and the philosophy, right?

653
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
And the phrase, religion.

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
So that's hard to have, sphere to sphere.

655
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Second, three, you never

656
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
forgot. You see Miles, you are

657
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
about the food, and the

658
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
quality, and the

659
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
direction, and Miles look at the

660
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
faces, handsome. That's the three

661
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
reasons. You forgot the point, Master.

662
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Miles is just a blower of me now.

663
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
What's a blower?

664
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Back in 2008

665
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
though, when I was at the

666
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Olympics, Miles was super

667
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
high level. I was just, I was

668
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
la bai jing. Yeah, yeah, you're really low.

669
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
I was la bai jing.

670
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
No, impossible to get in

671
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
pangolin.

672
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Top, top, top.

673
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Global elite, global elite.

674
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm

675
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
pretty wrong.

676
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
I need

677
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
all the clothes. Only you use

678
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
pangolin. Only you.

679
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
I guarantee.

680
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Okay.

681
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Okay.

682
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Okay.

683
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Okay.

684
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Okay.

685
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Okay.

686
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Okay.

687
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Okay.

688
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Okay.

689
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Okay.

690
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Okay,

691
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Okay,

692
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Okay.

693
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Okay,

694
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
okay,

695
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,440
然后刚才唐明杰的第二个问题呢

696
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,440
and have a great sense of humor right

697
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
and they understand how tough life is

698
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
but they they press on

699
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
so it's grit determination

700
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
belief and family values and tradition

701
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
honoring who came before you

702
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
right the family

703
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
and also the

704
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
the importance of knowledge and learning

705
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
right every Chinese family

706
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
I've met every young Chinese person

707
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
but how do I get

708
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
how do I do well in school

709
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
how do I go to the best schools

710
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
how do I learn

711
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
you can see this at G News and GTV

712
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
get all the companies

713
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
how do I learn my profession better

714
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
how do I get more skills

715
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
and the work ethic

716
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
you know you make

717
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
most of the times you have to send the young Chinese people home

718
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
right because this is going to work and work

719
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
and work and work and work

720
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
so it's that stick-to-it-iveness

721
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
it's that grit

722
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
it's that determination

723
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
you're making yourself better

724
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
that you're making future generations

725
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
you're providing a foundation for future generations

726
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
so Lao Bai Jing

727
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
look I come from the American version of Lao Bai Jing

728
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
we are my family is just the little guys

729
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
right all you know

730
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
80% 85% of my family

731
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
today the extended family

732
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
are blue collar workers

733
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
right laborers

734
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
you know craftsmen skilled craftsmen

735
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
but still Lao Bai Jing

736
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
but they have that same type of common quality

737
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
and family

738
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
and wanting to be left alone by the government

739
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
the government to tell them what to do

740
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
they don't want to tell them how many children they have

741
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
how to raise their children

742
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
how to educate their children

743
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
and so I think that those qualities

744
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
and those are the qualities

745
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
that are going to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party

746
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
because the Chinese Communist Party

747
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
is antithetical to all those values

748
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
they're all about money

749
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
and power and materialism

750
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
no faith

751
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
no spirituality

752
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
no caring about anybody

753
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
no grace

754
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
no gratitude

755
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
none of it

756
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
that's why three years ago today

757
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
remember what we put up shocked the world

758
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
we put the faces of all the people that disappeared

759
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
committed suicide

760
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
disappeared were in prison or had their assets stole

761
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
that's from a regime

762
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
who doesn't care about people

763
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
at all

764
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
and that's different than Lao Bai Jing

765
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
that's the values

766
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
of the traditional

767
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Chinese society

768
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
that will eventually overthrow

769
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
the dictatorial cruelty

770
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
and evilness of the Chinese Communist Party

771
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
thank you Mr.Bannon

772
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
刚才班农先生说

773
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
之所以他

774
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
把他的全部的生命

775
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
都要献给咱们的爆料革命

776
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
是因为他看到中国人

777
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
他的决心毅力

778
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
他看到中国人的这种生活方式

779
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
还说了中国人也非常的幽默

780
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
知道生活有多苦

781
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
但是还是非常非常努力工作

782
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
不停地都在问我怎么样可以做得更好

783
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
我怎么样可以提高

784
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
而且每一个中国人都非常的勤劳

785
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
非常的坚定

786
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
能够让自己更好

787
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
让自己的未来也更好

788
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
班农先生也说他自己是美国的老百姓

789
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
他们家的85%的人到现在都是蓝领

790
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
是普通的工人

791
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
他们也有和我们中国老百姓一样的品质

792
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
对比西方华尔街的巨头和现在的政府

793
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
他们没有信仰没有感恩

794
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
也没有仁慈

795
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
所以就是因为咱们有中华最传统

796
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
最珍贵的这些品质

797
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
才让他能够一直帮助咱们爆料革命

798
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
谢谢

799
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
好嘞

800
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
感谢了

801
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
班农先生问得非常好

802
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
我再说一遍

803
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
在中国的国际关系

804
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
言语

805
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
宗教

806
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
文化

807
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
中国的中国社会

808
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
和美国的历史

809
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
这是最困难的

810
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
他们称之为

811
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
精神性

812
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
每天三个小时

813
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
在晚餐后

814
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
每天都会去Lady May 2

815
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
喝一杯咖啡

816
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
听中国音乐

817
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
每天

818
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
每天120天

819
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
这是非常重要的

820
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
史蒂夫·金班农对我的心情

821
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
120天

822
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
没有一天

823
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
没有一天你问我中国老百姓

824
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
你很关心

825
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
为什么

826
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
中国没有中华人民共和国

827
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
为什么这可以发生

828
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
为什么长期以来

829
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
没有人会改变政策

830
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
我说因为美国和西方世界

831
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
中国是一个很坏的男人

832
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
中国是一个很大的太空

833
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
和最大的团体

834
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
他们是中国的文化

835
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
他们是中国的文化

836
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
他们是中国的文化

837
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
他们是美国的文化

838
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
他们是美国的文化

839
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
这是为什么我们分享了很多

840
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
国际的文化

841
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
宗教

842
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
文化

843
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
经济

844
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
技术

845
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
中国

846
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
CCP
